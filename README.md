# Battleships

A console battleships game. Not finished yet.

The game has kind of working multiplayer and a really
stupid AI, but that's about it. Made primarily to
learning the basics of Rust and networking.

## Quickstart

For singleplayer:
`cargo run --bin=main`

Multiplayer on a local network:
Launch the server:
`cargo run --bin=server`
And the client:
`cargo run --bin=client`
